                <h2>F2P Games Are Everywhere!</h2>
                
                <p>Do you really need to drop $60-$100 on some new big game? At this point there are so many free2play games that you don't really have too.
                    Majority of games make all their profits off of micro transactions to customize your characters or account, so if a game
                    is developed well enough they can sustain a game by leaving the door wide open for new players, then if you think the developers
                    deserve your hard earned cash then treat your self to some skins! Here are some of the highest quality f2p games out right now!

                <h3>#1 Apex Legends</h3>
                <p>My personal favorite is Apex Legends, this is a competitive first person shooter battle royale style game. It has huge maps with each map having its own 
                    features. Plenty of weapons that are regularly balanced so no matter what you end up with you can make it work. 
                    Quite a few Legends to play as that all have a single ability and ultimate that can fit anyones play style, with none of them being
                    too overpowered. What really makes the game feel unique is its movement, if you can master sliding, climbing, tap strafing, and keep in 
                    mind your positioning this game will feel insane! Framerates are amazing on any system as well! </p>

            <article class="content2">
                <h3>#2 Guild Wars 2</h3>
                <p>GW2 is a MMORPG that gives the base game out for free, unfortunately the base game does not come with mounts and gliders, but there is still 
                    an insane amount of content not to mention the graphics are amazing! If you appreciate an amazing story line then you can go through your personal 
                    story, or get to max level from events, map completion, or dungeons! You get access to two great PvP types if thats more up your ally, World vs World is a seige based PvP where 
                    you need to control as much territory as you can, or regular PvP for a 5v5 balanced game mode. With seasonal events and crafting you will always have 
                    something to do. If you like a game where you can play your way, there is so much customization through class traits, abilities, and gear that 
                    you can tailor your toon to your play style to either be insanely strong or unique.
                </p>

            <article class="content3">
                <h3>#3 League of Legends</h3>
                <p>League of Legends (LoL) is a MOBA style game, that might be the largest esport with more than 30 million people watching their championships at any given time. It is a 5v5 style game with over 150 different 
                    champions to play as with their own unique abilities! Everygame you're character starts at lvl 
                    1 and you race against the other team to gain xp to level up and gold to buy items or gear. You have a "jungle" in between the lanes you would
                    normally fight over that spawns different creatures for you to clear for extra gold/xp or for their different buffs for you and your team. I would only 
                    suggest this game to people who have a few friends to play with since the community/player base has, and probably always will be very toxic haha. But if you 
                    have tough skin or like to banter then you will have no problem brushing off some of your teamates not so supportive opinions! Good thing the game does have bots you 
                    can train on to get comfortable for the mechanics before you go in with other players. </p>
